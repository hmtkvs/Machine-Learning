In this project overfitting is studied in an experimental framework.

Problem is generated with a random degree distribution in input space [-1,1] with independently selected coefficients from a standard Normal distribution. 
Out-of-sample error and best fit functions have been generated for different number of samples and variances for different degrees of polynoms.
